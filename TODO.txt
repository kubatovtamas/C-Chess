1. Make:
    1. production target
    2. debug target
    3. unit test target
    4. main test target

2. Cunit tests
3. Profiling tests, valgrind (???)
macros, dynamic library, debug mode would be nice

Lib:
     - initialize board
     - save state
     - step (change state)
         * Hit
         * Castling
         * Promotion
     - undo, redo
     - save match
     - load match

Main:
     - request player name
     - step
         * validate step
             + wrong color
             + no piece
             + valid step
     - give up (defeated)
     - offer/accept tie
     - save as (filename)
         * (lib function)
     - load game
         * (lib function)

Game state:
    1 string representation for each piece (white/black)
    2D array of gameboard
    steps: doubly-linked list to allow undo and redo
        eg:
            Player: 1 (that moved)
            before:
                A2 - white pawn
            after:
                A3 - white pawn

            Player: 2
            before:
                B3 - black knight
                C5 - white bishop
            after:
                C5 - black knight
